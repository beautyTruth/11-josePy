## Another Game Code Along

It's a quarter past 11 on a beautiful late-July Sunday here in Council Bluffs, and I'm sitting in AC in front of an Apple M1 MacBook Air learning Python. Today, I embark on the second milestone project in Jose Portilla's Python boot camp course. There are about two hours worth of code along videos to get through, so I'll keep this coding journal short.

My sleep has been good for almost two weeks. My average monthly steps are at 10.8k as of today, July 30, and have been above 10k since March 01 of this year. I have pledged to not watch football in my apartment this coming season in order to better facilitate my machine learning studies. The goal is to be prepared to take and pass the TensorFlow certification exam in July of 2024. I have purchased multiple courses from Udemy to support the successful achievement of that goal.

With all of that said, I am off to learn from Jose.

UPDATE from July 31, 2023: I'm genuinely excited to begin coding this blackjack game simulation as part of Jose's course. I've goine through 48 years of life avoiding getting into the weeds of programming, but I think I may actually enjoy this. Like, I want to know more about it so that I can do more of it, if that makes sense. Fortune favors the bold, or something like that. Let's get to it. See you in my Python decorators coding journal in a couple of hours.
